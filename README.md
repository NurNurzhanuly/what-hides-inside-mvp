### 👁️ About the Project
"What Hides Inside?" is a graduation project developed as a part of a Software Engineering program. It explores the psychological themes of **social anxiety** and **fear of darkness** through an inverted gameplay mechanic. 

In traditional media, light represents safety. Here, the logic is flipped:
- **Light = Danger:** Representing social scrutiny and "burning" toxic environments.
- **Darkness = Sanctuary:** A place of inner peace, safety, and recovery.

### 🎮 Gameplay Features
- **Inverted Core Mechanic:** You play as a Shadow Boy who physically dissolves under intense light. 
- **Light Manipulation:** Use movable objects and environment to cast shadows and create safe paths.
- **Environmental Storytelling:** No explicit dialogue. The story is told through mood, sound, and visual metaphors.
- **Psychological Depth:** Designed with "Gentle Exposure" principles to help players rethink their relationship with fear.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack & Architecture
- **Engine:** Unity 6 (LTS).
- **Rendering:** Universal Render Pipeline (URP) with 2D Lights & Shadows.
- **Architecture:** 
  - **Decoupled Design:** Uses Interface-based input handling (`IInputProvider`) and damage systems (`IDamageable`).
  - **Event-Driven VFX:** Health and visual feedback are connected via Unity Events to ensure high modularity.
  - **Data-Driven:** ScriptableObjects for game balancing and level configuration.
